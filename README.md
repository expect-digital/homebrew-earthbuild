# homebrew-earthbuild

Before you begin, ensure you have Homebrew installed on your macOS system. If you don't, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

This repository contains the homebrew formula required to install `EarthBuild` on MacOS via `brew`.

## Installation

**Only alpha version is available at the moment. Stable version coming soon.**

First, add this tap to your local Homebrew setup. This makes the formulas within it available for installation.

```shell
brew tap earthbuild/earthbuild
```

For the latest stable version, run:

```shell
brew install earth
```

To install the alpha version directly from the main branch (which may be unstable), run:

```shell
brew install --HEAD earth
```
